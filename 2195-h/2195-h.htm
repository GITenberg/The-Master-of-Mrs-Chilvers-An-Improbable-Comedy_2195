Mogton</i>, <i>Hon. Sec. Women&rsquo;s Parliamentary Franchise

thousands of years have gone to her making.&nbsp; A generation
ago, she would have been the ideal woman: the ideal
helpmeet.&nbsp; But new ideas are stirring in her blood, a new
ideal of womanhood is forcing itself upon her.</p>

stupidity in keeping her out.</p>

freedom but through warfare.</p>

be discovered.</p>

<h2>THE FIRST ACT</h2>

<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Time</span>:&mdash;<i>Afternoon</i>.</p>
<p>(<span class="smcap">Mrs. Elizabeth Spender</span> <i>sits
near the fire</i>, <i>reading a book</i>.&nbsp; <i>She is a
tall</i>, <i>thin woman</i>, <i>with passionate eyes</i>, <i>set
in an oval face of olive complexion</i>; <i>the features are
regular and severe</i>; <i>her massive dark hair is almost primly
arranged</i>.&nbsp; <i>She wears a tailor-made costume</i>,
<i>surmounted by a plain black hat</i>.&nbsp; <i>The door opens
and</i> <span class="smcap">Phoebe</span> <i>enters</i>, <i>shown
in by</i> <span class="smcap">Hake</span>, <i>the butler</i>,
<i>a thin</i>, <i>ascetic-looking man of about thirty</i>,
<i>with prematurely grey hair</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Phoebe Mogton</span> <i>is of the Fluffy Ruffles
type</i>, <i>petite</i>, <i>with a retrouss&eacute; nose</i>,
<i>remarkably bright eyes</i>, <i>and a quantity of fluffy light
hair</i>, <i>somewhat untidily arranged</i>.&nbsp; <i>She is
fashionably dressed in the fussy</i>, <i>flyaway style</i>.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>looks up</i>; <i>the two
young women shake hands</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; Good woman.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t three o&rsquo;clock yet, is it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; About five minutes
to.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; Annys is on her
way.&nbsp; I just caught her in time.&nbsp; (<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Hake</span>.)&nbsp; Put a table and six
chairs.&nbsp; Give mamma a hammer and a cushion at her back.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hake</span>.&nbsp; A hammer, miss?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; A chairman&rsquo;s
hammer.&nbsp; Haven&rsquo;t you got one?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hake</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid not,
miss.&nbsp; Would a gravy spoon do?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span> (<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, <i>after expression of
disgust</i>.)&nbsp; Fancy a house without a chairman&rsquo;s
hammer!&nbsp; (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Hake</span>.)&nbsp;
See that there&rsquo;s something.&nbsp; Did your wife go to the
meeting last night?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hake</span> (<i>He is arranging furniture
according to instructions</i>.)&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not quite sure,
miss.&nbsp; I gave her the evening out.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gave her the
evening out&rdquo;!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; We are speaking of
your wife, man, not your servant.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hake</span>.&nbsp; Yes, miss.&nbsp; You
see, we don&rsquo;t keep servants in our class.&nbsp;
Somebody&rsquo;s got to put the children to bed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Why not the
man&mdash;occasionally?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hake</span>.&nbsp; Well, you see, miss, in
my case, I rarely getting home much before midnight, it would
make it so late.&nbsp; Yesterday being my night off, things
fitted in, so to speak.&nbsp; Will there be any writing,
miss?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; See that
there&rsquo;s plenty of blotting-paper.&nbsp; (<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.)&nbsp; Mamma always splashes
so.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hake</span>.&nbsp; Yes, miss.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">(<i>He goes out</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Did you ever hear
anything more delightfully na&iuml;ve?&nbsp; He
&ldquo;gave&rdquo; her the evening out.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how
they think of us&mdash;as their servants.&nbsp; The gentleman
hasn&rsquo;t the courage to be straightforward about it.&nbsp;
The butler blurts out the truth.&nbsp; Why are we meeting here
instead of at our own place?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; For secrecy, I
expect.&nbsp; Too many gasbags always about the office.&nbsp; I
fancy&mdash;I&rsquo;m not quite sure&mdash;that mamma&rsquo;s got
a new idea.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Leading to
Holloway?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; Well, most roads lead
there.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; And end
there&mdash;so far as I can see.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re too
impatient.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s what
our friends have been telling us&mdash;for the last fifty
years.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; Look here, if it was
only the usual sort of thing mamma wouldn&rsquo;t want it kept
secret.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m inclined to think it&rsquo;s a new
departure altogether.</p>
<p class="gutindent">(<i>The door opens</i>.&nbsp; <i>There

plain</i>, <i>uninteresting girl until she smiles</i>, <i>and
then her face becomes quite beautiful</i>.&nbsp; <span

girl.&nbsp; Was afraid&mdash;I say, you&rsquo;re wet through.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Janet</span>.&nbsp; It was only a
shower.&nbsp; The &rsquo;buses were all full.&nbsp; I had to ride
outside.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; Silly kid, why
didn&rsquo;t you take a cab?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Janet</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been
reckoning it up.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been half over London chasing
Mrs. Mountcalm-Villiers.&nbsp; Cabs would have come, at the very
least, to twelve-and-six.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; Well&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Janet</span> (<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.)&nbsp; Well&mdash;I want you to
put me down as a contributor for twelve-and-six.&nbsp; (<i>She
smiles</i>.)&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the only way I can give.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; (<i>She is taking
off</i> <span class="smcap">Janet&rsquo;s</span> <i>cloak</i>;
<i>throws it to</i> <span class="smcap">Hake</span>.)&nbsp; Have
this put somewhere to dry.&nbsp; (<i>She pushes</i> <span
class="smcap">Janet</span> <i>to the fire</i>.)&nbsp; Get near
the fire.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re as cold as ice.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; All the seats
inside, I suppose, occupied by the chivalrous sex.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Janet</span>.&nbsp; Oh, there was one
young fellow offered to give me up his place, but I
wouldn&rsquo;t let him.&nbsp; You see, we&rsquo;re claiming
equality.&nbsp; (<i>Smiles</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; And are being
granted it&mdash;in every direction where it works to the
convenience of man.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp;
(<i>Laughs</i>.)&nbsp; Is she coming&mdash;the Villiers
woman?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Janet</span>.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I ran her
down at last&mdash;at her dress-maker&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She made an
awful fuss about it, but I wouldn&rsquo;t leave till she&rsquo;d
promised.&nbsp; Tell me, it&rsquo;s something quite important,
isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
anything, except that I had an urgent telegram from mamma this
morning to call a meeting of the entire Council here at three
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s coming up from Manchester on
purpose.&nbsp; (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Hake</span>.)&nbsp;
Mrs. Chilvers hasn&rsquo;t returned yet, has she?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hake</span>.&nbsp; Not yet, miss.&nbsp;
Shall I telephone&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; (<i>Shakes her
head</i>.)&nbsp; No; it&rsquo;s all right.&nbsp; I have seen
her.&nbsp; Let her know we are here the moment she comes in.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hake</span>.&nbsp; Yes, miss.</p>
<p class="gutindent">(<i>He has finished the
arrangements</i>.&nbsp; <i>The table has been placed in the
centre of the room</i>, <i>six chairs round it</i>, <i>one of
them being a large armchair</i>.&nbsp; <i>He has placed writing
materials and a large silver gravy spoon</i>.&nbsp; <i>He is
going</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; Why aren&rsquo;t you
sure your wife wasn&rsquo;t at the meeting last night?&nbsp;
Didn&rsquo;t she say anything?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hake</span>.&nbsp; Well, miss,
unfortunately, just as she was starting, Mrs.
Comerford&mdash;that&rsquo;s the wife of the party that keeps the
shop downstairs&mdash;looked in with an order for the
theatre.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; Oh!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hake</span>.&nbsp; So I thought it best to
ask no questions.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hake</span>.&nbsp; Thank you, miss.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">(<i>He goes out</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Can nothing be
done to rouse the working-class woman out of her apathy?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; Well, if you ask me,
I think a good deal has been done.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Oh, what&rsquo;s
the use of our deceiving ourselves?&nbsp; The great mass are
utterly indifferent.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Janet</span> (<i>She is seated in an
easy-chair near the fire</i>.)&nbsp; I was talking to a woman
only yesterday&mdash;in Bethnal Green.&nbsp; She keeps a husband
and three children by taking in washing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,
miss,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;what would we do with the vote
if we did have it?&nbsp; Only one thing more to give to the
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s rather
good.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; The curse of it is
that it&rsquo;s true.&nbsp; Why should they put themselves out
merely that one man instead of another should dictate their laws
to them?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; My dear girl,
precisely the same argument was used against the Second Reform

them?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Simply that they
don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing.&nbsp; The French
Revolution was nursed in the salons of the French nobility.&nbsp;
When the true meaning of the woman&rsquo;s movement is understood
we shall have to get on without the male sympathiser.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">(<i>A pause</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annys</span>.&nbsp; What do you understand
is the true meaning of the woman&rsquo;s movement?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; The dragging down
of man from his position of supremacy.&nbsp; What else can it
mean?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annys</span>.&nbsp; Something much
better.&nbsp; The lifting up of woman to be his partner.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; My dear Annys, the
men who to-day are advocating votes for women are doing so in the
hope of securing obedient supporters for their own political
schemes.&nbsp; In New Zealand the working man brings his female
relations in a van to the poll, and sees to it that they vote in
accordance with his orders.&nbsp; When man once grasps the fact
that woman is not going to be his henchman, but his rival, men
and women will face one another as enemies.</p>

has just reminded us that in the eye of the law all women are

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mountcalm-Villiers</span>.&nbsp; I
know, dear.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it shocking?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Herbert</span>.&nbsp; Deplorable; but
of course not your fault.&nbsp; I mention it because of its
importance to the present matter.&nbsp; Under Clause A of the Act
for the Better Regulation, &amp;c., &amp;c., all persons
&ldquo;mentally deficient&rdquo; are debarred from becoming
members of Parliament.&nbsp; The classification has been held to
include idiots, infants, and women.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">(<i>An interruption</i>.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Lady Mogton</span> <i>hammers</i>.)</p>
<p>Bearing this carefully in mind, we proceed.&nbsp; (<i>He
refers to his notes</i>.)&nbsp; Two years ago a bye-election took
place for the South-west division of Belfast.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mountcalm-Villiers</span>.&nbsp; My
dear, may I?&nbsp; It has just occurred to me.&nbsp; Why do we
never go to Ireland?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Mogton</span>.&nbsp; For various
sufficient reasons.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mountcalm-Villiers</span>.&nbsp; So
many of the Irish members have expressed themselves quite
sympathetically.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Mogton</span>.&nbsp; We wish them to
continue to do so.&nbsp; (<i>Turns to</i> <span class="smcap">St.
Herbert</span>.)&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Herbert</span>.&nbsp; A leader of the
Orange Party was opposed by a Nationalist, and the proceedings
promised to be lively.&nbsp; They promised for a while to be
still livelier, owing to the nomination at the last moment of the
local lunatic.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; (<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Annys</span>.)&nbsp; This is where we come in.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Herbert</span>.&nbsp; There is always
a local lunatic, who, if harmless, is generally a popular
character.&nbsp; James Washington McCaw appears to have been a
particularly cheerful specimen.&nbsp; One of his eccentricities
was to always have a skipping-rope in his pocket; wherever the
traffic allowed it, he would go through the streets
skipping.&nbsp; He said it kept him warm.&nbsp; Another of his
tricks was to let off fireworks from the roof of his house
whenever he heard of the death of anybody of importance.&nbsp;
The Returning Officer refused his nomination&mdash;which, so far
as his nominators were concerned, was intended only as a
joke&mdash;on the grounds of his being by common report a person
of unsound mind.&nbsp; And there, so far as South-west Belfast
was concerned, the matter ended.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; Pity.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Herbert</span>.&nbsp; But not so far
as the Returning Officer was concerned.&nbsp; McCaw appears to
have been a lunatic possessed of means, imbued with all an
Irishman&rsquo;s love of litigation.&nbsp; He at once brought an
action against the Returning Officer, his contention being that
his mental state was a private matter, of which the Returning
Officer was not the person to judge.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t a
lunatic all over.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Herbert</span>.&nbsp; We none of us
are.&nbsp; The case went from court to court.&nbsp; In every
instance the decision was in favour of the Returning
Officer.&nbsp; Until it reached the House of Lords.&nbsp; The
decision was given yesterday afternoon&mdash;in favour of the man
McCaw.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Then lunatics, at
all events, are not debarred from going to the poll.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Herbert</span>.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;mentally deficient&rdquo; are no longer debarred from
going to the poll.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; What grounds were
given for the decision?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Herbert</span>.&nbsp; (<i>He refers
again to his notes</i>.)&nbsp; A Returning Officer can only deal
with objections arising out of the nomination paper.&nbsp; He has
no jurisdiction to go behind a nomination paper and constitute
himself a court of inquiry as to the fitness or unfitness of a
candidate.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; Good old House of
Lords!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">(<span class="smcap">Lady
Mogton</span> <i>hammers</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; But I thought it
was part of the Returning Officer&rsquo;s duty to inquire into
objections, that a special time was appointed to deal with
them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Herbert</span>.&nbsp; He will still be
required to take cognisance of any informality in the nomination
paper or papers.&nbsp; Beyond that, this decision relieves him of
all further responsibility.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Janet</span>.&nbsp; But this gives us
everything.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Herbert</span>.&nbsp; It depends upon
what you call everything.&nbsp; It gives a woman the right to go
to the poll&mdash;a right which, as a matter of fact, she has
always possessed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; Then why did the
Returning Officer for Camberwell in 1885&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Herbert</span>.&nbsp; Because he did
not know the law.&nbsp; And Miss Helen Taylor had not the means
possessed by our friend McCaw to teach it to him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annys</span>.&nbsp; (<i>Rises</i>.&nbsp;
<i>She goes to the centre of the room</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Mogton</span>.&nbsp; Where are you

<p><span class="smcap">Annys</span>.&nbsp; (<i>She turns</i>;
<i>there are tears in her eyes</i>.&nbsp; <i>The question seems
to recall her to herself</i>.)&nbsp; Nowhere.&nbsp; I am so
sorry.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp; It seems to me to mean
so much.&nbsp; It gives us the right to go before the
people&mdash;to plead to them, not for ourselves, for them.&nbsp;
(<i>Again she seems to lose consciousness of those at the
table</i>, <i>of the room</i>.)&nbsp; To the men we will say:
&ldquo;Will you not trust us?&nbsp; Is it harm we have ever done
you?&nbsp; Have we not suffered for you and with you?&nbsp; Were
we not sent into the world to be your helpmeet?&nbsp; Are not the
children ours as well as yours?&nbsp; Shall we not work together
to shape the world where they must dwell?&nbsp; Is it only the
mother-voice that shall not be heard in your councils?&nbsp; Is
it only the mother-hand that shall not help to
guide?&rdquo;&nbsp; To the women we will say: &ldquo;Tell
them&mdash;tell them it is from no love of ourselves that we come
from our sheltered homes into the street.&nbsp; It is to give,
not to get&mdash;to mingle with the sterner judgments of men the
deeper truths that God, through pain, has taught to
women&mdash;to mingle with man&rsquo;s justice woman&rsquo;s
pity, till there shall arise the perfect law&mdash;not made of
man nor woman, but of both, each bringing what the other
lacks.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they will listen to us.&nbsp; Till now it
has seemed to them that we were clamouring only for selfish
ends.&nbsp; They have not understood.&nbsp; We shall speak to
them of common purposes, use the language of
fellow-citizens.&nbsp; They will see that we are worthy of the
place we claim.&nbsp; They will welcome us as helpers in a common
cause.&nbsp; They&mdash;</p>

resolution.&nbsp; (<i>She takes up a paper on which she has been

bye-election.&nbsp; (<i>Suddenly to</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs.

<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; How do you
know?&nbsp; Nothing more full of surprises than English law.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Mogton</span>.&nbsp; At the present
stage I regard that point as immaterial.&nbsp; What I am thinking
of is the advertisement.&nbsp; A female candidate upon the
platform will concentrate the whole attention of the country on
our movement.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Herbert</span>.&nbsp; It might even be
prudent&mdash;until you have got the vote&mdash;to keep it dark
that you will soon be proceeding to the next inevitable step.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; You think even man
could be so easily deceived!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Herbert</span>.&nbsp; Man has had so
much practice in being deceived.&nbsp; It comes naturally to
him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Poor devil!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Mogton</span>.&nbsp; The only
question remaining to be discussed is the candidate.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annys</span>.&nbsp; Is there not danger
that between now and the next bye-election the Government may,
having regard to this case, bring in a bill to stop women
candidates from going to the poll?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Herbert</span>.&nbsp; I have thought
of that.&nbsp; Fortunately, the case seems to have attracted very
little attention.&nbsp; If a bye-election occurred soon there
would hardly be time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Mogton</span>.&nbsp; It must be the
very next one that does occur&mdash;wherever it is.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Janet</span>.&nbsp; I am sure that in the
East End we should have a chance.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; Great Scott!&nbsp;

<p><span class="smcap">St. Herbert</span>.&nbsp; If you could get
a straight fight against a Liberal I believe you would.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annys</span>.&nbsp; Why is the Government
so unpopular?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Herbert</span>.&nbsp; Well, take the
weather alone&mdash;twelve degrees of frost again last night.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Janet</span>.&nbsp; In St. George&rsquo;s

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Mogton</span>.&nbsp; Has anybody any
suggestion to make?&mdash;as regards the candidate.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s no advantage in going outside.&nbsp; It will have
to be one of ourselves.</p>

not.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Mogton</span>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not a
question of liking.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a question of duty.&nbsp;
For this occasion we shall be appealing to the male voter.&nbsp;
Our candidate must be a woman popular with men.&nbsp; The choice
is somewhat limited.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; No one will put up

some news.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve got some
news for you.&nbsp; Have you heard&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; (<i>He stays
her</i>.)&nbsp; May I claim man&rsquo;s privilege for the first
word?&nbsp; It is news, I am sure, you will all be delighted to
hear.&nbsp; A friend of yours has been appointed to an office
where&mdash;it is quite possible&mdash;he may be of service to
you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; Governorship of
Holloway Gaol?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; Not a bad
guess.&nbsp; Very near it.&nbsp; To the Under-Secretaryship for
Home Affairs.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Mogton</span>.&nbsp; Who is it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; (<i>He

<p><span class="smcap">Annys</span>.&nbsp; Geoffrey!&nbsp;
(<i>She puts her arms about him</i>.)&nbsp; You never told me
anything.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; I know, dear.&nbsp;
I was afraid.&nbsp; It mightn&rsquo;t have come off.&nbsp; And
then you would have been so disappointed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annys</span>.&nbsp; (<i>There are tears in
her eyes</i>.&nbsp; <i>She still clings to him</i>.)&nbsp; I am
so glad.&nbsp; Oh, I am so glad!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; It is all your
doing.&nbsp; You have been such a splendid help.&nbsp; (<i>He
breaks gently away from her</i>.&nbsp; <i>Turns to</i> <span
class="smcap">St. Herbert</span>, <i>with a lighter
tone</i>.)&nbsp; Haven&rsquo;t you anything to say to a
fellow?&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not usually dumb.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Herbert</span>.&nbsp; It has all been
so sudden&mdash;as the early Victorian heroine was fond of
remarking!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp;
(<i>Laughs</i>.)&nbsp; It has been sudden.&nbsp; We had, none of
us, any idea till yesterday that old Bullock was thinking of
resigning.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; (<i>She has risen
and moved towards the fire</i>.)&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t it necessitate
a bye-election?</p>
<p class="gutindent">(<span class="smcap">Lady Mogton</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; (<i>He turns to

Yes.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t anticipate a contest.&nbsp; The
Conservatives are without a candidate, and I am on good terms
with the Labour Party.&nbsp; Perhaps Mr. Hunnable&mdash;(<i>He
laughs</i>, <i>then</i>, <i>turning</i>, <i>catches sight of his
wife&rsquo;s face</i>.&nbsp; <i>From</i> <span
class="smcap">Annys</span> <i>he looks to the others</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Mogton</span>.&nbsp; (<i>She has
risen</i>.)&nbsp; You haven&rsquo;t heard, then, of McCaw versus
Potts?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; &ldquo;McCaw versus
Potts!&rdquo;&nbsp; What the&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Herbert</span>.&nbsp; Was decided in
the House of Lords late yesterday afternoon.&nbsp; Briefly
stated, it confers upon women the right of becoming Parliamentary
candidates.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; (<i>He is
staggered</i>.)&nbsp; You mean&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Mogton</span>.&nbsp; Having regard to
which, we have decided to bring forward a woman candidate to
contest the next bye-election.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; Um!&nbsp; I
see.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annys</span>.&nbsp; But we never
thought&mdash;we never anticipated it would be
Geoffrey&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Mogton</span>.&nbsp; I really cannot
admit that that alters the case.&nbsp; Geoffrey himself would
never dream, I am sure, of asking us to sacrifice our cause to
his convenience.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Of course
not.&nbsp; Certainly not.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Mogton</span>.&nbsp; It is perhaps
unfortunate that the candidate selected&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annys</span>.&nbsp; It is quite
impossible.&nbsp; Such a dilemma was never dreamed of.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Mogton</span>.&nbsp; And if
not?&nbsp; Is the solidarity of woman&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; (<i>Beginning to
guess</i>.)&nbsp; Forgive my impatience; but whom <i>have</i> you
selected?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; (<i>When she likes
she can be quite sweet</i>.)&nbsp; Your wife.&nbsp; (<i>He
expected it</i>.)&nbsp; We rather assumed (<i>she appeals to the
others with a gesture</i>), I think, that the president of the
Man&rsquo;s League for the Extension of the Franchise to Women
would regard it as a compliment.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; (<i>His dislike of
her is already in existence</i>.)&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Very
thoughtful.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annys</span>.&nbsp; You must choose some
one else.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; But there <i>is</i>
no one else.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annys</span>.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
mamma.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mamma&rsquo;s
too heavy.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annys</span>.&nbsp; Well, then,
there&rsquo;s Elizabeth&mdash;there&rsquo;s you!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Why not
you?&nbsp; You and I could have a jolly little fight.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Mogton</span>.&nbsp; This is not a
laughing matter.&nbsp; If I could think of any one to take
Annys&rsquo;s place I should not insist.&nbsp; I cannot.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; You see, it
mustn&rsquo;t be a crank.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; (<i>He is losing
his temper</i>.)&nbsp; Yes, I suppose that does limit you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; And
then&mdash;thanks to you&mdash;Mrs. Chilvers has had such
excellent training in politics.&nbsp; It was that, I think, that
decided us.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; (<i>Convention
forbids his strangling her</i>.)&nbsp; Will somebody kindly
introduce me to this lady?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Herbert</span>.&nbsp; Ah, yes, of
course.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know each other, do you?&nbsp; Mr.
Geoffrey Chilvers&mdash;Mrs. Joseph Spender.&nbsp; Mrs.
Spender&mdash;Mr. Chilvers, M.P.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp;

Charmed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Mogton</span>.&nbsp; (<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Annys</span>.)&nbsp; I am not indifferent to your
difficulty.&nbsp; But the history of woman, my dear Annys, is a
history of sacrifice.&nbsp; We give our sons&mdash;if necessary,
our husbands.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mountcalm-Villiers</span>.&nbsp;
(<i>Affected</i>.)&nbsp; How true!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annys</span>.&nbsp; But you are not asking
me to give him.&nbsp; You are asking me to fight him.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Mogton</span>.&nbsp; You mean you
won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annys</span>.&nbsp; You can put it that
way if you like.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">(<i>A pause</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Janet</span>.&nbsp; I thought Mrs.
Chilvers had pledged her word.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; But
without her husband&rsquo;s consent.&nbsp; So, of course, it
doesn&rsquo;t count.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; (<i>He turns on
her</i>.)&nbsp; Why not you&mdash;if there must be a fight?&nbsp;
Or would it be against your principles?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Not in the
least.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; Ah!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; I would offer
myself as a substitute.&nbsp; Only it might seem like coming
between husband and wife.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; (<i>He turns away
with a grunt of disgust</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s awfully
rough on you, Geoffrey.&nbsp; I can see it from your point of
view.&nbsp; But one can&rsquo;t help remembering the things that
you yourself have said.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; I know; I
know.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been going up and down the country,
excusing even your excesses on the ground that no movement can
force its way to the front without treading on innumerable
toes.&nbsp; For me, now, to cry halt merely because it happens to
be my own toes that are in the way would
be&mdash;ridiculous&mdash;absurd&mdash;would be monstrous.&nbsp;
(<i>Nobody contradicts him</i>.)&nbsp; You are perfectly
justified&mdash;if this case means what you say it does&mdash;in
putting up a candidate against me for East Poplar.&nbsp; Only,
naturally, it cannot be Annys.&nbsp; (<i>He reaches out his hand
to where</i> <span class="smcap">Annys</span> <i>stands a little
behind him</i>, <i>takes her hand</i>.)&nbsp; Annys and I have
fought more than one election.&nbsp; It has been side by
side.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; The lady a little

<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; (<i>He moves away
with an expression of deep annoyance</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Janet</span>.&nbsp; (<i>She comes
forward</i>.&nbsp; <i>She holds forth her hands with a
half-appealing</i>, <i>half-commanding gesture</i>.&nbsp; <i>She
almost seems inspired</i>.)&nbsp; Would it not be so much better
if, in this first political contest between man and woman, the
opponents were two people honouring one another, loving one
another?&nbsp; Would it not show to all the world that man and
woman may meet&mdash;contend in public life without anger,
without scorn?&nbsp; (<i>There is a pause</i>.&nbsp; <i>They
stand listening</i>.)&nbsp; I do not know, but it seems to me
that if Mr. Chilvers could bring himself to do this it would be
such a big thing&mdash;perhaps the most chivalrous thing that a
man has ever done to help women.&nbsp; If he would put aside,
quite voluntarily, all the man&rsquo;s privilege&mdash;just say
to the people, &ldquo;Now choose&mdash;one of us two to serve
you.&nbsp; We stand before you, equal, my wife and
I.&rdquo;&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know how to put it, but I feel that
by merely doing that one thing Mr. Chilvers would solve the whole
problem.&nbsp; It would prove that good men are ready to give us
of their free accord all that we claim.&nbsp; We should gain our
rights, not by warfare, but through love and understanding.&nbsp;
Wouldn&rsquo;t that be&mdash;so much better?&nbsp; (<i>She
looks&mdash;her hands still appealing&mdash;from one to the

<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; Yes, there&rsquo;s
a good deal, of course, in what Miss Blake says.</p>

big thing for you to do.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span>.&nbsp; You see, whatever
happened, the seat would be yours.&nbsp; This case only gives us
the right to go to the poll.&nbsp; We are keen upon Annys because
she&rsquo;s our best card, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; Do you wish it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annys</span>.&nbsp; (<i>She smiles up at
him</i>.)&nbsp; I&rsquo;d rather fight you than any one else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; Yes, but

situation.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Herbert</span>.&nbsp; (<i>He comes to
him</i>, <i>stands looking down at him</i>.)&nbsp; Did it never
occur to you, when you were advocating equal political rights for

Socialism?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Herbert</span>.&nbsp; Quite the most

<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; And not afraid of
being honest.&nbsp; Do you remember his answer when somebody
asked him what he would do if Socialism, by any chance, really
became established in England?&nbsp; He had just married an
American heiress.&nbsp; He said he should emigrate.&nbsp; I am
still convinced that woman is entitled to equal political rights
with man.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t think it was coming in my
time.&nbsp; There are points in the problem remaining to be
settled before we can arrive at a working solution.&nbsp; This is
one of them.&nbsp; (<i>He takes up the letter and
reads</i>.)&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you prepared to have as your
representative a person who for six months out of every year may
be incapacitated from serving you?&rdquo;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s easy
enough to say I oughtn&rsquo;t to allow my supporters to drag in
the personal element.&nbsp; I like it even less myself.&nbsp; But

<p style="text-align: right">(<i>Finds his cap and goes
out</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Herbert</span>.&nbsp; The answer, I
should say, would be that the majority of women will continue to
find something better to do.&nbsp; The women who will throw
themselves into politics will be the unattached women, the
childless women.&nbsp; (<i>In an instant he sees his mistake</i>,

<p><span class="smcap">St. Herbert</span>.&nbsp; (<i>He shrugs
his shoulders</i>.)&nbsp; Are there any such?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; There are women who
talk openly of woman&rsquo;s share in the general scheme being a
&ldquo;burden&rdquo; on her&mdash;an &ldquo;incubus.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Herbert</span>.&nbsp; A handful of
cranks.&nbsp; To the normal woman motherhood has always been the
one supreme desire.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; Because children
crowned her with honour.&nbsp; The barren woman was
despised.&nbsp; All that is changing.&nbsp; This movement is
adding impulse to it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Herbert</span>.&nbsp; Movements do not
alter instincts.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; But they do.&nbsp;
Ever since man emerged from the jungle he has been shedding his
instincts&mdash;shaping them to new desires.&nbsp; Where do you
find this all-prevailing instinct towards maternity?&nbsp; Among
the women of society, who sacrifice it without a moment&rsquo;s
hesitation to their vanity&mdash;to their mere pleasures?&nbsp;
The middle-class woman&mdash;she, too, is demanding
&ldquo;freedom.&rdquo;&nbsp; Children, servants, the
home!&mdash;they are too much for her &ldquo;nerves.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And now there comes this new development, appealing to the
intellectual woman.&nbsp; Is there not danger of her preferring
political ambition, the excitement of public life, to what has
come to be regarded as the &ldquo;drudgery&rdquo; of turning four
walls into a home, of peopling the silence with the voices of the
children?&nbsp; (<i>He crosses to the table&mdash;lays his hand
again upon the open letter</i>.)&nbsp; How do you know that this
may not be her answer&mdash;&ldquo;I have no children.&nbsp; I
never mean to have children&rdquo;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peekin</span>.&nbsp; (<i>He changes from

<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; I see.&nbsp; But is
there no difference between the two doors?&nbsp; I am not an
accomplice.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Peekin</span>.&nbsp; An accomplice!&nbsp;
Is the ignorant servant-girl&mdash;first lured into the
public-house, cajoled, tricked, deceived by false
promises&mdash;the half-starved shop-girl in the hands of the
practised libertine&mdash;is she an accomplice?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peekin</span>.&nbsp; (<i>A
dowdily-dressed</i>, <i>untidy woman</i>, <i>but the face is
sweet and tender</i>.)&nbsp; Ah, Mr. Chilvers, if you could only
hear the stories that I have heard from dying lips.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; Very pitiful, my
dear lady.&nbsp; And, alas, only too old.&nbsp; But there are
others.&nbsp; It would not be fair to blame always the man.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annys</span>.&nbsp; (<i>Unnoticed</i>,
<i>drawn by the subject</i>, <i>she has risen and come
down</i>.)&nbsp; Perhaps not.&nbsp; But the punishment always
falls on the woman.&nbsp; Is <i>that</i> quite fair?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; (<i>He is irritated
at</i> <span class="smcap">Annys&rsquo;s</span> <i>incursion into
the discussion</i>.)&nbsp; My dear Annys, that is Nature&rsquo;s
law, not man&rsquo;s.&nbsp; All man can do is to mitigate it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Peekin</span>.&nbsp; That is all we
ask.&nbsp; The suffering, the shame, must always be the
woman&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Surely that is sufficient.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; What do you
propose?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Borlasse</span>.&nbsp; (<i>In her
deep</i>, <i>fierce tones</i>.)&nbsp; That all children born out
of wedlock should be a charge upon the rates.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Ricketts</span>.&nbsp; (<i>A
slight</i>, <i>fair</i>, <i>middle-aged woman</i>, <i>with a
nervous hesitating manner</i>.)&nbsp; Of course, only if the
mother wishes it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; (<i>The proposal
staggers him</i>.&nbsp; <i>But the next moment it inspires him
with mingled anger and amusement</i>.)&nbsp; My dear, good
people, have you stopped for one moment to consider what the
result of your proposal would be?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Peekin</span>.&nbsp; For one thing, Mr.
Chilvers, the adding to the populace of healthy children in place
of the stunted and diseased abortions that is all that these poor
women, out of their scanty earnings, can afford to present to the
State.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; Humph!&nbsp; That
incidentally it would undermine the whole institution of
marriage, let loose the flood-gates that at present hold
immorality in check, doesn&rsquo;t appear to trouble you.&nbsp;
That the law must be altered to press less heavily upon the
woman&mdash;that the man must be made an equal sharer in the
penalty&mdash;all that goes without saying.&nbsp; The remedy you
propose would be a thousand times worse than the disease.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annys</span>.&nbsp; And meanwhile?&nbsp;
Until you have devised this scheme (<i>there is a note of
contempt in her voice</i>) under which escape for the man will be
impossible?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; The evil must
continue.&nbsp; As other evils have to until the true remedy is
found.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Peekin</span>.&nbsp; (<i>He has hurriedly
consulted with the others</i>.&nbsp; <i>All have risen&mdash;he
turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.)&nbsp; You will
not support our demand?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; Support it!&nbsp;
Do you mean that you cannot yourselves see that you are holding
out an indemnity to every profligate, male and female, throughout
the land&mdash;that you would be handicapping, in the struggle
for existence, every honest man and woman desirous of bringing up
their children in honour and in love?&nbsp; Your suggestion is
monstrous!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Peekin</span>.&nbsp; (<i>The little man is
not without his dignity</i>.)&nbsp; We apologise, Mr. Chilvers,
for having taken up your time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; I am sorry the
matter was one offering so little chance of agreement.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Peekin</span>.&nbsp; We will make only one
slight further trespass on your kindness.&nbsp; Mrs. Chilvers, if
one may judge, would seem to be more in sympathy with our
views.&nbsp; Might we&mdash;it would be a saving of time and shoe
leather (<i>he smiles</i>)&mdash;might we take this opportunity
of laying our case before her?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; It would be

away from you?&nbsp; Why cannot we work together for common ends,
each in our own way?</p>

leadership.</p>

going to take you away from me.&nbsp; I want you.&nbsp; No, I
don&rsquo;t want a friend&mdash;&ldquo;a

doing.&nbsp; I can get all that outside my home.&nbsp; I want a
wife.&nbsp; I want the woman I love to belong to me&mdash;to be
mine.&nbsp; I am not troubling about being up to date; I&rsquo;m
talking what I feel&mdash;what every male creature must have felt
since the protoplasmic cell developed instincts.&nbsp; I want a

Square</i>.&nbsp; <i>The morning-room</i> (<i>on the ground
floor</i>).&nbsp; <i>A small</i>, <i>cheerful room</i>,
<i>furnished in Chippendale</i>, <i>white panelled</i>, <i>with
Adams fireplace in which a bright fire is burning</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Two deep easy-chairs are before the fire</i>.&nbsp; <i>The
window-curtains of red damask are drawn</i>.&nbsp; <i>An oval
table occupies the centre of the room</i>.&nbsp; <i>The door at
back opens upon the hall</i>.&nbsp; <i>Only one light burns</i>,
<i>an electric lamp on a table just above the fire</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Time</span>:&mdash;<i>Midnight</i>.</p>
<p>(<i>The door opens</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Geoffrey</span> <i>enters</i>.&nbsp; <i>He has left
his out-door things in the hall</i>.&nbsp; <i>He crosses and
rings the bell</i>.&nbsp; <i>A moment</i>.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center">(<span class="smcap">Hake</span>
<i>enters</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; Oh, you,
Hake!&nbsp; There wasn&rsquo;t any need for you to have
stopped.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hake</span>.&nbsp; I was not sure of your
arrangements.&nbsp; I thought perhaps I might be wanted.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; I
ought to have told you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hake</span>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been no
inconvenience, sir.&nbsp; I told Mrs. Hake not to sit up.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; (<i>He is opening
and reading his letters left for him on the table</i>.)&nbsp;
Does she generally sit up for you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hake</span>.&nbsp; As a rule, sir.&nbsp;
We like a little chat before going to bed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; (<i>His eyes on a
letter</i>.)&nbsp; What do you find to chat about?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hake</span>.&nbsp; Oh, there is so much
for a husband and wife to talk about.&nbsp; The&mdash;&nbsp; As a
rule.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">(<i>A clock on the mantelpiece
strikes one</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s
that?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hake</span>.&nbsp; Quarter past twelve,
sir.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; Has your mistress
come in?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hake</span>.&nbsp; Not yet, sir.&nbsp; Has
the election gone all right, sir?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; For Mrs. Chilvers,
yes.&nbsp; She is now member for East Poplar.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hake</span>.&nbsp; I am sorry.&nbsp; It
has been a great surprise to me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; The result?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hake</span>.&nbsp; The whole thing,
sir.&nbsp; Such a sweet lady, we all thought her.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; Life, Hake, is a
surprising affair.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">(<i>A ring is heard</i>.)</p>
<p>I expect that&rsquo;s she.&nbsp; She has forgotten her
key.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">(<span class="smcap">Hake</span>
<i>goes out</i>.)</p>
<p class="gutindent">(<span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>
<i>continues his letters</i>.&nbsp; <i>A few moments pass</i>;
<span class="smcap">Hake</span> <i>re-enters</i>, <i>closes the
door</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hake</span>.&nbsp; (<i>He seems
puzzled</i>.)&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a lady, sir</p>
<p style="text-align: center">(<span
class="smcap">Geoffrey</span> <i>turns</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hake</span>.&nbsp; At least&mdash;hardly a
lady.&nbsp; A Mrs. Chinn.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; Mrs. Chinn!&nbsp;
(<i>He glances at his watch</i>.)&nbsp; At twelve o&rsquo;clock
at night.&nbsp; Well, all right.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll see her.</p>
<p class="gutindent">(<span class="smcap">Hake</span> <i>opens
the door</i>, <i>speaks to</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Chinn</span>.&nbsp; <i>She enters</i>, <i>in bonnet and
shawl</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hake</span>.&nbsp; Mrs. Chinn.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; Good evening, Mrs.
Chinn.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; Good evening,
sir.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; You needn&rsquo;t
stop, Hake.&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t be wanting anything.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hake</span>.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; Apologise for me to
Mrs. Hake.&nbsp; Good-night.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hake</span>.&nbsp; Good-night, sir.</p>
<p class="gutindent">(<span class="smcap">Hake</span> <i>goes
out</i>.&nbsp; <i>A minute later the front door is heard to
slam</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you sit
down?&nbsp; (<i>He puts a chair for her left of the
table</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; (<i>Seating
herself</i>.)&nbsp; Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; (<i>He half sits on
the arm of the easy-chair below the fire</i>.)&nbsp; What&rsquo;s
the trouble?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my
boy, sir&mdash;my youngest.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s been taking money
that didn&rsquo;t belong to him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; Um.&nbsp; Has it
been going on for long?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; About six months,
sir.&nbsp; I only heard of it to-night.&nbsp; You see, his wife
died a year ago.&nbsp; She was such a good manager.&nbsp; And
after she was gone he seems to have got into debt.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; What were his
wages?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; Nineteen
shillings a week, sir.&nbsp; And that with the rent and three
young children&mdash;well, it wants thinking out.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; From whom did he
take the money&mdash;his employers?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; Yes, sir.&nbsp;
He was the carman.&nbsp; They had always trusted him to collect
the accounts.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; How much, would you
say, was the defalcation?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; I beg pardon,
sir.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; How much does it
amount to, the sums that he has taken?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; Six pounds, sir,
Mr. Cohen says it comes to.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t they
accept repayment?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; Yes, sir.&nbsp;
Mr. Cohen has been very nice about it.&nbsp; He is going to let
me pay it off by instalments.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; Well, then, that
gets over most of the trouble.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; Well, you see,
sir, unfortunately, Mr. Cohen gave information to the police the
moment he discovered it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; Umph!&nbsp;
Can&rsquo;t he say he made a mistake?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; They say it must
go for trial, sir.&nbsp; That he can only withdraw the charge in
court.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; Um!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; You see,
sir&mdash;a thing like that&mdash;(<i>She recovers
herself</i>.)&nbsp; It clings to a lad.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; What do you want me
to do?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; Well, sir, I
thought that, perhaps&mdash;you see, sir, he has got a brother in
Canada who would help him; and I thought that if I could ship him
off&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; You want me to tip
the wink to the police to look the other way while you smuggle
this young malefactor out of the clutches of the law?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; (<i>Quite
indifferent to the moral aspect of the case</i>.)&nbsp; If you
would be so kind, sir.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; Umph!&nbsp; I
suppose you know what you&rsquo;re doing; appealing through your
womanhood to man&rsquo;s weakness&mdash;employing
&ldquo;backstairs influence&rdquo; to gain your private ends,
indifferent to the higher issues of the public weal?&nbsp; All
the things that are going to cease when woman has the vote.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; You see, sir,
he&rsquo;s the youngest.</p>
<p class="gutindent">(<i>Gradually the decent but dingy figure
of</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span> <i>has taken to
itself new shape</i>.&nbsp; <i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>, <i>it almost seems as though there
were growing out of the shadows over against him the figure of
great Artemis herself&mdash;Artemis of the Thousand
Breasts</i>.&nbsp; <i>He had returned home angry</i>, <i>bitter
against all women</i>.&nbsp; <i>As she unfolds her simple tale
understanding comes to him</i>.&nbsp; <i>So long as there are</i>
&ldquo;<i>Mrs. Chinns</i>&rdquo; <i>in the world</i>, <i>Woman
claims homage</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; How many were
there?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; Ten altogether,
six living.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; Been a bit of a
struggle for you, hasn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; It has been a bit
difficult, at times; especially after their poor father died.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; How many were you
left with?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; Eight, sir.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; How on earth did
you manage to keep them?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; Well, you see,
sir, the two eldest, they were earning a little.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t think I could have done it without that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t there
any source from which you could have obtained help?&nbsp; What
was your husband?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; He worked in the
shipyards, sir.&nbsp; There was some talk about it.&nbsp; But, of
course, that always means taking the children away from you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; Would not that have
been better for them?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; Not always,
sir.&nbsp; Of course, if I hadn&rsquo;t been able to do my duty
by them I should have had to.&nbsp; But, thank God, I&rsquo;ve
always been strong.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; (<i>He
rises</i>.)&nbsp; I will see what can be done.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; Thank you,
sir.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; (<i>Half-way</i>,
<i>he turns</i>.)&nbsp; When does the next boat sail&mdash;for
Canada?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; To-morrow night,
sir, from Glasgow.&nbsp; I have booked his passage.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; (<i>With a
smile</i>.)&nbsp; You seem to have taken everything for
granted.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; You see, sir,
it&rsquo;s the disgrace.&nbsp; All the others are doing so
well.&nbsp; It would upset them so.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">(<i>He goes out</i>.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center">(<i>There is a moment</i>.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center">(<span class="smcap">Annys</span>

things</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annys</span>.&nbsp; Mrs. Chinn!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; (<i>She has
risen</i>; <i>she curtseys</i>.)&nbsp; Good evening,
ma&rsquo;am.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annys</span>.&nbsp; (<i>She is taking off
her hat</i>.)&nbsp; Nothing wrong, is there?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; My boy,
ma&rsquo;am, my youngest, has been getting into trouble.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annys</span>.&nbsp; (<i>She pauses</i>,
<i>her hat in her hand</i>.)&nbsp; They will, won&rsquo;t
they?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s nothing serious, I hope?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; I think it will
be all right, ma&rsquo;am, thanks to your good gentleman.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annys</span>.&nbsp; (<i>She lays aside her
hat</i>.)&nbsp; You have had a good many children, haven&rsquo;t
you, Mrs. Chinn?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; Ten altogether,
ma&rsquo;am; six living.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annys</span>.&nbsp; Can one love ten, all
at once?</p>
<p class="gutindent">(<i>The cloak has fallen aside</i>.&nbsp;

lady</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; Just as many as
come, dear.&nbsp; God sends the love with them.</p>
<p class="gutindent">(<i>There is a moment</i>; <i>the two women
are very close to one another</i>.&nbsp; <i>Then</i> <span

their arms are round one another</i>.)</p>
<p class="gutindent">(<i>She mothers her into the easy chair

great.</p>

tears, dearie.&nbsp; (<i>She arranges the foot-stool</i>.)&nbsp;
You keep your feet up.</p>

heard</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span> <i>is

<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; Well, Mrs. Chinn,
an exhaustive search for the accused will be commenced&mdash;next
week.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; Thank you,
sir.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; What about the
children&mdash;are they going with him?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; No, sir; I
thought he would be better without them till everything is
settled.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; Who is taking care
of them&mdash;you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; Yes, sir.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; And the passage
money&mdash;how much was that?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; Four pound
fifteen.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; Would you mind my
coming in, as a friend?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Chinn</span>.&nbsp; Well, if you
don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;d rather not.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve always
done everything for the children myself.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been a
fad of mine.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; (<i>He makes a
gesture of despair</i>.)&nbsp; You mothers!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re so
greedy.&nbsp; (<i>He holds out his hand</i>,

<p style="text-align: right">(<i>He closes the door</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annys</span>.&nbsp; Only a few
minutes&mdash;while you were at the telephone.&nbsp; I had to
rest for a little while.&nbsp; Dr. Whitby brought me back in his
motor.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>.&nbsp; Was he down
there?</p>

him.&nbsp; I had been taken a little giddy earlier in the
day.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
